# Portswigger Burpsuite Lab Write-ups

This repo is my learning log as I tackle PortSwigger’s **Web Security Academy** labs. I’m just getting started, so expect mostly *Apprentice-level* content for now more advanced notes will appear as I progress.

## Why Publish These?

- **Learn by teaching** – writing forces understanding.  
- **Help others** – short, beginner-friendly guides.  
- **Show skills** – practical proof of web-app-sec fundamentals.
